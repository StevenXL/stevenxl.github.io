Margin, border, and padding are very important topics to understand, given their
importance to how elements are rendered, displayed, and positioned.

Crucial to understanding margin, border, and padding is the idea that every
element on a web page sits in an imaginary "box". The amount of space between
the content in that box and the border of that box is called padding. After the
padding, sits the border. The border can be made as thick as necessary. Finally,
between the border and any other element sits the margin. The margin creates
space between the element with the margin and other elements around it. If two
margins overlap, then the largest margin applies. It is important to understand
that when we set the width of an element, we are actually setting the width of
the content of that element. The amount of padding, border, and margin add to
the actual width of the element.
