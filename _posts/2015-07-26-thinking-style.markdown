Understanding my own thinking style is an important part of being an efficient
learner. As a **Concrete Random** learner, I am a hands-on learning. I learn
best by experimenting, trying things out, and seeing what works and what does
not work.

I think that this is a good match to DBC's way of teaching. While learning
through tutorials and written material is great, it is only once you are able to
sit down and build things - something that DBC highly encourages - that the
material will be internalized.

My learning style has not been a struggle for me so far in Phase 0.  What has
been a struggle for me is time management. In particular, as the
responsibilities at my regular job heat up, I am finding myself struggling more
and more to keep my head above water.

I am a complete convert to the growth mindset. I believe that, with diligent and
purposeful effort, anyone can in fact learn anything.  Furthermore, I also
believe that it is the student that is most responsible for their learning and
for making their experience what they'd like it to be.
