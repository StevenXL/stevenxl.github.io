excerpt: DBC represents a career change for me. In this post, I enumerate why I believe programming is the correct career for me.

When I reflect back on the times that I have been the happiest or most proud,
several recurring values come to mind. I've listed these below in a table:

<table class="u-full-width">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Exploring</th>
      <th>My</th>
      <th>Values</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Enthusiasm</td>
      <td>Purity</td>
      <td>Competence</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Quality</td>
      <td>Order</td>
      <td>Self-Reliance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Autonomy</td>
      <td>Growth</td>
      <td>Efficiency</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Reflection on Values

These values reflect the factors that are important to me, and they generally
fall into two major categories. First, I find satisfaction in a job well-done.
By this I mean that the work-product not only met its goals, but that it was
accomplished efficiently, in a timely manner, with the right level of resources
and with best practices in mind. Secondly, I also value work that helps me grow
personally. By this, I am speaking specifically about projects that have taught
me something new, or that provide me with time necessary to grow outside of the
project itself. (Ahem - work / life balance anyone?).
