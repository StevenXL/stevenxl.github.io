excerpt: What is Stereotype Threat? And why is it so controversial?
---
*Stereotype threat* is a situation in which individuals fail to perform at their
best due to anxiety about confirming a negative stereotype about their social
group.

One of the interesting observations that I made while researching stereotype
threat is that there seems to be a lot of criticism levied at this particular
social theory. While a healthy about of skepticism is healthy (and common when
it comes to untested theories), it seems that the level of disbelief regarding
stereotype threat is unwarranted given what I believe to be modest claims. The
idea that anxiety can lower performance is not new, and is in fact common in
many contexts. What stereotype threats adds is that anxiety can be induced by
fear of confirming a stereotype regarding one's social group.
